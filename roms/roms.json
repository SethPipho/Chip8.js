VIP Biorhythm\n\nThe theory of Biorhythm states that there are thre predominant cycles that can influence\nhuman behavior.  These include a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle and a\n33-day intellectual cycle.  All three cycles start at birth and continue throughout life.\n\nEach cycle consists of a positive and a negative period.  Physical, Emotional and\nIntellectual aspects are enhanced during positive periods.  Poor performance is\nindicated by the negative period of a cycle.\n\nA critical day occurs on the crossover from the positive to the negative period or\nvice versa.  A critical day indicates instability in a particular aspect.\n\n\nHow to Use VIP Biorhythm\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2.

Lunar Lander\n\nYou are descending to the floor of a 250-foot crater.  The right side of the TV display\nshows amount of fuel, feet from bottom and fall rate per cycle.  Lenght of fall rate\ncycle changes from about 1/4 second to one second.  The fall rate increases by one\nfoot per second/per cycle.  The computer will update the display only at the end of\neach cycle.\n\nThe left side of the display shows the Lunar Lander descending from 250 feet.  The\nLander will first appear at one of sixteen locations.  It will then slowly drop down\nthe crater.  The crater walls have rock formations protruding from them which must\nbe avoided.  If either rocket motor should touch any part of the crater, the Lander\nwill explode in a cloud of smoke and disintegrate.  (Remember, these are atomic\nthrusters and react like miniature atomic bombs upon impact).\n\nWhen you reach 32 feet, the display will change, and you will see the crater floor.\nYou must now ladn between the rock formations on the floo and maintain a minimum fall\nrate.  As you drop your fall rate to zero, you soon discover that the Lander becomes\nmore and more unstable just as any hovering object would.  And now with perfect skill\nyou guide the ship in for a perfect touch down, or?\n\nHow to Play VIP Lunar Lander\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and teh game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Key 2 controls the thrust of the Lunar Lander.  One tone beep equals one pound\n   of fuel and one foot of thrust.\n\n3. Key 4 controlls the horizontal stabilizing engine,  and moves the Lander one\n   foot to the left per one pound of fuel.\n\n4. Key 6 controls the stabilization to the right.\n\n5. Stabilization controls only react after: (a) a complete fall cycle, or (b) after\n   the Key 2 thrust control is pressed.  You must be aware of this at all times or\n   you will crash even though either key 4 or 6 is pressed.\n\n6. At the end of each cycle, the Lunar Lander will move randomly at the rate of one\n   foot either right or left.  Therefore, as the fall rate approaches zero, the Lander\n   becomes more uncontrollable, and your horizontal stabilizers react more quickly.\n   (Just like the real thing).\n\n7. If you land too fast, the Lander will bounce and flip over.\n\n8. If you run out of fuel, the Lander will crash.\n\n9. You will not be allowed to go above 250 feet.  If you try to do so, you will just\n   waste precious fuel.\n\n10. Once you reach 32 feet and move into the landing display, you will not be allowed\n    to rise above 26 feet.  Trying to do so will waste more precious fuel.\n\n11. Game options\n  \n    You may select one of three options at the begining of the game.\n\n    Option 1: You start at 250 feet.  You are given 150 pounds of fuel.  You must land\n              at 5 feet per second or less.  The initial descent display is easy to\n              maneuver through.\n\n    Option 2: You start at 250 feet.  You have 200 pounds of fuel.  You must land at 3 feet\n              per second or less.  The initial descent display is hard to maneuver through.\n\n    Option 3: You start at 32 feet.  You have 100 pounds of fuel.  You must land at 3 feet\n              per second or less.  This display allows you to practice landing.  \n\n    You should consider Option 2 as the complete game when trying for Astronaut Ratings.\n\n12. Astronaut Ratings\n\n    The computer will award you with ratings depending on how good a lander you are.\n\n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut by landing without regard to fall rate or\n    fuel.  You must not exceed fall rate, or zero fuel.\n    \n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Pilot, by ladning with regard to fuel.  80\n    pounds or more if you land between the two rock formations on the floor, and 50\n    pounds or more if you land between the crater wall and a rock formation.\n\n    You will obtain the rating of Astronaut Captain by landing the ship with regard to\n    fuel as per above and if the fall rate is two feet per second or less.  (Not an\n    easy task, as you will soon discover).\n\n13. About Graphics\n\n    This game has some interesting graphic displays when you run out of fuel, crash,\n    land too fast, when you land successfully.  I will leave them to your discovery,\n    as they are fun to watch.\n\n14. Landing Sites\n\n    The final landing display will appear somewhat like the illustration below\n    (VIPG1-15.jpg).  You may land in any of the three locations pointed to.  To land\n    between the crater walls and rock formations, you will have to first bring the\n    Lander to a zero fall rate while hovering in the center landing area.  Then bring\n    the ship up and just over the rock formation, and let it drop down to the landing\n    site.

This game is distributed by Invicta Plastics, Suite 940, 200 - 5th Ave., New York, NY 10010, and is available most pLaces where toys and games are sold.\nFor complete details of the game, please refer to their instructions. The information given here refers to this particular VIP iurplementation.\nThe two versions are essentially the same except that the first has a four number code and the second has a five  nr:mber hidden code selected at random..  In the four number version, the digits one through six are used and in the five  number version the diglts zero through seven are used.\nWhile the game is running, the other hex keys, except key F, have no effect. Key F is used when you change your mind and want to change your input. This key erases the current partial entry.\nThe game starts by displaying a series of dashes arranged in rows. As the game progresses, the player attempts to  deduce the hidden code by replacing the dashes with digits entered via the hex keyboard. Each tlme a hex key is used, the selected digit replaces a dash in  one vertical column. This vertical column is one guess of the ten allowed to deduce\nthe hidden number. When the bottom dash in any column is replaced by a digit,  that try is imidiately scored. This score appears below the current column. If any digit in the column exactly matches the hidden number digit in the same row, a broken bar will appear. then four or five (one for each row in the game) appear, the hidden number has been deduced\nand it will be revealed at the right end of  the screen. If any digit in the column matches a hidden digit, but in an incorrect erorr, a white bar will appear. Note that the scoring is across all rows. For example, if there are two fives in a column and one of then is in the correct row and there is only one five in the hidden numbers, one broken bar will appear.\nWhen all allowed ten tries  have been used, the hidden number will be revealed. \n\n"}, "./Chip-8 Games/Merlin [David Winter]": {"name": "Merlin [David Winter]", "file": "Chip-8 Games/Merlin [David Winter].ch8", "sys": "ch8", "description": "Merlin, by: David Winter\n\nThis is the SIMON game.

VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\nProgrammable Spacefighters is a combat game involving 2 to 8 spaceships competing\nfor the domination of a contained field in space.  The field of play is a \ntwo-dimensional representation of an oblong spheroid.\n\nThe movement and fire of each spacefighter is controlled by programming a series of\ncommands into each fighter's instruction storage table.  Once all the spacefighters\nare programmed, they carry out their commands by sequentially executing a single step\nat a time.  The play of the game ins divided into rounds.  Each spacefighter may\nexecute between 1 and 15 commands per round.\n\nThe fighters all have the same appearance and capabilities.  Players distinguish\nbetween fighters by examining the defense strength and position of their fighters\nat the begining of every round.\n\nEach fighter may face in any of 8 directions.  All firing and forward movement\noccurs in the direction the fighter is currently facing.  As a spacefighter crosses\noutside the two-dimensional field of play, it wraps around and re-enters on the\nopposite side of the field.  Laser bursts terminate when they travel outside the\nfield or hit a target.\n\nEach round consists of a selected number of steps.  Each step is executed in 2 parts.\nDuring the first part, every spacefighter wishing to fire may execute a fire operation.\nThe defense strength of any fighter which is hit by a laser burst is reduced by 1\nand a small flash appears.\n\nAfter all fighters have had an opportunity to execute fire instructions, the movement\npart of the step begins.  Any fighter which has had its defense strength reduced to 0\nis destroyed and a longer flash appears.  The defense strength is changed to a special\ncode so that the fighter will no longer be programmable or take part in the execution\nphase.  The destroyed fighter will still be open to examination during the Defense/\nPosition Check phase.  Fighers having a defense strength greater than 0 may execute\na movement command if there is one.  Breaking each step into 2 such parts removes any\nstrategic advantage to moving first.\n\nThe nature of the game, in that there are variable parameters and no fixed victory\nconditions, allows the players a lot of freedom.  Two to eight players can command\nsingle fighters.  Four or less players can each command multiple fighters.  Two\nfleets could complete to destroy their opponents' flagship first.  Handicaps can\nbe implemented through an imbalance of fighters in different fleets.  An odd number\nof players can play in a free for all or team game.  In a non-combat approach, a full\ncomplement of space fighters could be programmed to preform in kaleidoscope or other\ntype formations.\n\n\nHow to Play VIP Programmable Spacefighters\n\n1. Load the CHIP-8 interpreter at 0000-01FF and\n   the game starting at 0200.\n\n2. Turn RUN switch on.\n\n3. Initalization of Game.\n   Various parameters are entered at the start of the game to determine the number\n   of spacefighters and other aspects of play.\n\n   S: Enter number of spacefighters.  1 to 8 spacefighters may be used.  The program\n      will adjust invalid enteries to the nearest valid number.\n\n   D: Enter defense strength.  A spacefighter may be hit from 1 to F times by laser\n      before being destroyed.\n\n   E: Enter number of command entries.  A spacefighter may be programmed with 1 to F\n      commands during the programming phase of each round.\n\n   C: Enter clock duration/no clock.  A timer clock 1 to F phorseks in duration may\n      be selected.  Each phorsek equals 4 seconds.  The clock is not enabled if a 0\n      is entered.  The clock time is the time allowed for each fighter to be set up.\n\n   F: Enter fire power available.  A spacefighter may be allowed to fire 1 to F\n      laser bursts per round.\n\n   A: Enter accumulation/no accumulation.  A spacefighter may be allowed to accumulate\n      all unused laser bursts by entering 1 to F.  Accumulation is not allowed if a\n      0 is entered.\n\n4. Presentation of Field and Spacefighters.\n   The two-dimensional representation of the palying fields consists of 10 vertical\n   by 15 horizontal positons indicated by grid markings around the perimeter.  The\n   spacefighters will be in their initial positions.\n\n5. Defense/Position Check.\n     Enter number of spacefighter to be examined.\n     S: Current spacefighter being examined.\n     D: Defense strength of current spacefighter.\n     Enter 0 to end defense/position check phase.\n\n6. Program Spacefighters.\n   Surviving spacefighters are programmed in ascending order.  Enter 0 to begin\n   programming first spacefighter.  Defense strength and position are shown during\n   programming.\n     E: indicates number of enteries left after current command.\n     C: indicates time remaining to program current fighter if clock was entered.\n\n    COMMAND   FUNCTION\n      1        Rotate 45 ccw, Move fwd\n      2        Move fwd\n      3        Rotate 45 cw, Move fwd\n      4        Rotate 45 ccw\n      5        Fire\n      6        Rotate 45 cw\n      B        Erase all commands and reprogram current spacefighter\n      E        End programming of current spacefighter\n      7-A,C,D,F  Rest, No operation\n      0        Rest, Begin programming next spacefighter\n\n   Enter 0 to begin programming each successive spacefighter.\n\n7. Execute Commands.\n   Enter 0 after all spacefighters are programmed to start execution of commands.\n\n8. The recommended starting point when tryint the game out is with 1 or 2 spacefighters,\n   any defense, F (15) entries per round, no clock, F (15) fire power and any accumulation\n      S: 1 or 2\n      D: 1\n      E: F\n      C: 0\n      F: F\n      A: 0\n\n   Use the above to try out the movement and fire execution of the fighters.  Try\n   performing loops, figure 8's, tight turns, maximum fire coverage techniques, etc.\n   Start out simple when first playing the game against an opponent.  \n   Eight spacefighters can get very complicated.\n\n9. Changing different parameters creates very different effects on the play of the game.\n   The main effect of a large number of fighters is a more complicated game.  A large\n   number of enteries per round results in a more lively game involving farsighted\n   planning.  Fewer enteries involves more thinking and reacting to immediate developments\n   but is not without strategy when there are multiple fighters opposing each other.\n   The clock provides pressure which can be greatly increased by the moves-to-time ratio.\n   More fire power increases the importance of movement and positioning.  Accumulation\n   of fire power can have long range effects if there is low fire power and a large\n   number of moves per round.\n"}, "./Chip-8 Games/Puzzle": {"name": "Puzzle", "file": "Chip-8 Games/Puzzle.ch8", "sys": "ch8", "description": ""}, "./Chip-8 Games/Reversi [Philip Baltzer]": {"name": "Reversi [Philip Baltzer]", "file": "Chip-8 Games/Reversi [Philip Baltzer].ch8", "sys": "ch8", "description": "6. VIP REVERSI\nReversi is a game over 100 years old, which has become popular recently under the\nname Othello.  The game is played on a 8x8 square, using two kinds of markers.\nIn VIP Reversi one player has the open markers and the other player the solid\nmarkers.  The score for either player at any time is the total number of his markers\non the square.\n\nHow to play VIP Reversi\n\n1.

The 8x8 square will be formed and the starting marker configuration shown, having\n   two of each kind of marker in the center four locations of the square.  The starting\n   score for each player is shown as 02 above a line of his markers.\n\n4. Your VIP indicates the player's turn by blinking that player's score and also blinking\n   a cursor dot in the 8x8 square.  A player moves the blinking cursor dot in the 8x8\n   square by pressing the direction keys 1-4 and 6-9 as shown. (VIPG1-6.JPG)\n\n5. When the cursor-dot is properly located, the player presses key 5 to place his marker\n   on the square.  You will find that your VIP will not allow you to make a non-valid\n   play.  The only placements allowed are onces for which at least one of the other\n   player's markers is surrounded between an existing marker of your own and your new\n   marker being placed.  All these markers must be in consecutive positions on the\n   square and can be in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.  Once a new\n   marker has been placed, your VIP will change all such surrounded markers of the\n   other player to your kind and change the scores.\n\n6. Sometimes it may not be possible for a player to make a valid move.  If this happens\n   he must forfeit his move by pressing the \"F\" key! The game ends when neither player\n   can play or when the 8x8 square is completely filled with markers.  The goal is to\n   end the game with the highest score.

It has since\nappeared on other computers under various names.  Why it was\ncalled syzygy, I have no idea (consult Websters).  However, since\nthe HP48SX has approximately the same memory, graphics and cpu\npower as my TRS-80 did (something like 16kB, 128x64, and a 1.2Mhz Z80),\nI thought it would be amusing to play it again.  Now, approximately\nto my recollection, and with many apologies to the original author,\nhere is a CHIP48 version of SYZYGY.  Enough drivel.\n\nThe object of the game is to seek out \"targets\".  You do this with\nyour syzygy.  Initially small, the syzygy will grow by some amount\neach time a target is hit.  Eventually, your syzygy will\nbe so long as to make tougher and tougher to get any points (and easier\nand easier to get killed).  Confused?  Just try it.\n\nAnyways, the syzygy is not allowed to run into anything except targets.\nIt cannot run into the screen border (if present), or itself (this \nincludes backing into itself).  Fast and immediate death will result.\nDon't worry if you die quickly a few times.  The keys take a few \nminutes to get used to.\n\nTo start:     +      start/restart game with border\n              -      start/restart borderless game\n       \nTo play:      9      up\n              6      down\n              1      left\n              2      right\n\n[Hint for frustrated beginners: hold left hand on 1 & 2, and right hand on\n 6 & 9 keys.

Piper!  **********************\n\nOBJECT:\n-------\nYou are presented with a 6 row, 10 column grid and\na preview panel of 5 pipes. A starting pipe will be\nplaced on the grid and will in a few seconds start\nleaking.  The object is to lay pipes on the grid to\ncontain the leak as long as you can.  If the water\nflows onto an empty grid site, onto the side of another\npipe or border, that plumbing job is finished.  If you\ndid well enough, you may get another job.  Otherwise\nthe game is over.\n\nSTARTING THE GAME:\n-----------------\nMake sure you have the SCHIP program on the calculator.\nPress HPIPER to recall the program string to the stack.\nThen press SCHIP to start the game.\n\nHOW TO PLAY:\n------------\nOn the bottom and right borders of the grid are grid\npointers.  The bottom pointer can be moved left with\nthe (1) key and right with the (2) key.  The side\npointer can be moved up with the (9) key and down with\nthe (6) key. (Note: this is identical to the movement\nkeys for Syzygy by Roy Trevino)  A crosshair is present\non the grid sites the two paddles point to.\n\nUsing the pointers, chose a grid site to place a pipe.\nThe pipe to be placed is the one at the bottom of\nthe preview column. Once a site is chosen, press the\n(7) or (4) key to place the pipe there.  You can replace\na pipe already at the grid site with a penalty of one\npoint.  You cannot replace a pipe that the water has\nalready flown through.  Trying to do this will make\nyou lose the pipe you were trying to place and also\npenalize you one point.\n\nThe two buttons used to place pipe differ in the way\nthat the next pipe added at the top of the queue.\nPressing (7) will choose a random new pipe to place\nat the top of the preview column and push the others\ndown the queue.  Pressing (4) will use the pipe\ncurrently displayed to the right of the grid as the\nnew pipe to be placed at the top of the preview\ncolumn.  The pipes on the right cycle through all\ntypes in a set manner.\n\nWhen you have placed all the pipe you wish to for\na particular job, you can press the (+) key to make\nthe water flow *FAST*.  You can still lay pipe if\nyou realize you made a mistake, but hurry!\n\n   KEY SUMMARY:     Left     (1)\n                    Right    (2)\n                    Up       (9)\n                    Down     (6)\n                    Place    (7)  random\n                    Place    (4)  non-random\n                    Fast     (+)\n\nOnce a job is over, press (SPACE) to continue.\n\nThere are twenty levels with increasing water flow speed.\nLevel 20's speed is the same as that for *FAST*. If\nyou manage to get through level 20, it repeats at\nthat level till you fail.  The starting speed with\nwhich the flow comes out of the initial pipe is slower\nthan the usual flow, however this speed increases in\nlevel also. \n\nSCORING:\n--------\nYou receive 3 points for every pipe the water flows\nthrough.  For the crossed pipes, flowing through\nthem in both directions gives you 6 points.\nYou are penalized 1 point for replacing or\ntrying to replace a pipe already on the grid.\n\nThe current job score is shown in upper right corner.\nThe score can not go negative, so if the score is\nzero, you can replace pipes without penalty.\n\nOnce a job is over, the program checks to see if\nevery grid site was flown through. If so you\nearn a 100 point bonus. The score earned is added to\nthe grand total and displayed on the screen shown\nafter (SPACE) is pressed. \n\nIf the game is over, the word OVER will be displayed\nabove the score and the (SPACE) key can be pressed\nto exit. The total score will be written to user \nflags so that the user lang program SCORE can\nput the score on the stack. If over does not appear,\npress (SPACE) to go on to the next job.\nThe points needed to go to the next job are\nobtained by the following formula:\n\n    Points needed = 100 - (41 - 2 * level)\n\ntherefore, you need 63 points to go to job 2\n                    65 points to go to job 3\n                    ...\n                    99 points to go to job 20,21,....\n\nThe points needed for a level are shown below the\nbottom right corner of a grid.  Note that this\ndoes not mean that play ends once that score\nis achieved.  That score is only a minimum needed\nto have the opportunity to continue on another job.\n\nRESUME:\n-------\nBetween jobs (i.e. while at the dripping faucet wait\nscreen) you can press the decimal (.) key to leave\nthe game and go to the regular calculator mode.  The\ntotal score and level you achieved will be stored in\nthe user flags so that next time you start the game,\nyou will resume the game as you left it.  Do not\nrun the SCORE program or you will lose the resumable\nstate.\n\nIf somehow the user flags get messed up by other\nprograms you run after pausing, you can set them\nusing the HPSET program.  Put the desired score\non level 2 and the game level you just completed\non level 1. Once you get really good at the game,\nyou can use this to bypass the first few really\nslow screens. For example, to start off on level 9,\nenter 0 then 8 and run HPSET. When you start the\ngame, you will begin at level 10.\n\nRANDOMNESS:\n----------\nThe starting pipe for the first level is still \nplaced randomly.  For subsequent levels, however,\nthe starting pipe is located on the grid site\nyou \"leaked\" on with the starting direction opposite\nof that you entered.  If you leaked onto the border,\nthen the starting pipe is placed on the site you\nleaked from.\n\nThe first five pipes in the queue are selected randomly.\n\nOTHER REMARKS:\n-------------\n-- The [ENTER] key will now work to restart\n   the game as if it was just run for the first time.\n-- The movement keys can now be held down to\n   move the crosshair long distances.\n-- Corner pieces are guaranteed for the first four\n   pipes to get out of sticky situations with\n   the starting pipe placement.\n\nTROUBLE SHOOTING:\n----------------\nSome people have reported assorted problems with\ngetting the program to work.  For those who can't get\nSCHIP to work with H. Piper, try turning off all alarms\nand date/clock displays.  If you have Chipper,\nyou might try compiling the source code yourself and\nsee if you can get it to run from there.  \n\n\nDEVELOPMENT NOTES:\n-----------------\nPipe Graphics --\n   As you will probably notice, a lack of\n   color is a big problem in trying to sort\n   out what you have laid out.  Having 8x8\n   pipe bitmaps was a cornerstone of my\n   design so enlarging them for better\n   resolution would be difficult and probably\n   restrict the grid size unduly.\n\nRandomness    --\n   Just how random is S-CHIP's random generator?\n   You will probably notice that the cross pipe\n   comes up more often than the others. True. It\n   is twice as likely to be chosen than any of\n   the others.  Another design fluke. However,\n   being the one true symmetrical piece, it\n   will be the most useful to get often.\n\nProgram Size  --\n   I've put a semi-rigid limit of 2K on the size\n   of the program.  Any improvement that will put it over\n   that barrier just won't be worth it. (I will of course\n   probably eat these words later.)\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:\n----------------\nH.

If you got money to give it, you're a thief.\n\n\n\n       The rules of this game are very simple: the game is played\n       in a variable size grid made of 3*3 to 8*8 squares, so the\n       level of the game is designated by the width of the grid.\n       Initially, all the squares of the grid are WHITE. The goal\n       is to turn then BLACK by inverting their color, knowing\n       that inverting the colour of a square will also invert these\n       of the squares placed just on the left, right, up and down\n       of it...\n       Some levels are very simple: level 3 can be finished with\n       only 5 inversions, and level 4 needs only 4 inversions to\n       be completed...\n       Once a level is completed, the game is finished. To play\n       again, just reset the emulator.\n\n       I know I could have implemented some sort of inversions\n       counter, and next-level playing after a level is finished,\n       but I missed some time to do this... Anyway, have fun !\n\n       I could also have given the source of this program, but it\n       is not documented, so it would not be interesting to those\n       who are looking for help in programming.\n\n\n       The keys are:\n                   [8] :   UP\n                   [4] :   LEFT (lower level under level selection)\n                   [5] :   INVERT SQUARE (start game under level selection)\n                   [6] :   RIGHT (upper level under level selection)\n                   [2] :   DOWN\n"}, "./SuperChip Games/Matches": {"name": "Matches", "file": "./SuperChip Games/Matches.ch8", "sys": "sch8", "description": ""}, "./SuperChip Games/Mines! - The minehunter [David Winter, 1997]": {"name": "Mines! - The minehunter [David Winter, 1997]", "file": "./SuperChip Games/Mines! - The minehunter [David Winter, 1997].ch8", "sys": "sch8", "description": ""}, "./SuperChip Games/Single Dragon (Bomber Section) [David Nurser, 1993]": {"name": "Single Dragon (Bomber Section) [David Nurser, 1993]", "file": "./SuperChip Games/Single Dragon (Bomber Section) [David Nurser, 1993].ch8", "sys": "sch8", "description": "Greetings All...\n\nI have written the first part of a game called \"Single Dragon\"\nwhich is, if you didn't already guess, a spin off of \"Double Dragon\".\n\nThe only problem is that I didn't think that doing two degrees could be so\nmuch work, and lately it has ground to a halt (exam time ;[).\n\nI have included the ASCed directory of everything I have done so far,\nand am asking you to help me finish this great game off.\n\nHERE IS THE GAME STRATEGY\n\nStages 1-4   ::  Fight Scenes.\n                 Max of 3 enemys on screen @ once\n                 Enemys do not home in on your position in level #1\n                 A big guy to kill @ the end of stage 4\n                 after killing the big guy you jump into a helicopter and\n                      onto stage #5\n\nStage 5      ::  Helicopter Scene - landscape scrolls in from the right\n                 you can bomb ground lauched missiles etc (u get the pic)\n\nStage 6      ::  Car Scene, screen scrolls in from the top\n\nStage 7-10   ::  Fight Scenes of major proportions to finish off.\n\n\nSo, what have I already done?\n-> Stages 1-4 (no big guy @ end yet)\n-> 1/2 of stage 5\n\nAs you can see, I'm about half way through the game and will probably get more\ntime to finish it in about a month, but would really like some moral support\nand perhaps a helping hand.\n\nHOW WAS IT ALL WRITTEN ?\nThe bomber stage (a bit flickery at the moment) and all of the fight\nsequences were written in Super-Chip (Which of course you will need to have\nto run these stages).

Scientists think that they\nare being drawn towards the Earth due to the massive pollution the PC's cause.\nHowever if people had bought Amiga's instead (which don't pollute) they would\nhave been no aliens now!\n  This is your call! You sneak into a Warp-Transporter without a ticket and you\nend up at NASA where you get to talk to the boss and you tell him : \"OK you\nlisten to me you scumbag! I wanna get into a spacecraft, get up there and KICK\nSOME ALIEN BUTT!\". \"But why?\" the boss says. \"Personal motives\" you answer.

You are the Captain of a sub\nhunting destroyer, and your objective is to sink as many enemy U-Boats as\nyou can.  Your only weapon against the U-Boats is your ship's supply of\ndepth charges.  You have an unlimited supply of charges but, due to the\namount of time it takes your second rate crew to reload, you may only have\nfour charges in the water at any given time.\n\nThe subs that you are hunting appear at random depths and have one of\nthree random velocities (stopped, ahead half, or ahead full).\nThere are six enemy subs visible at any one time.  When one of these\nsubs is destroyed, another will appear at a different location.\n\nThe keys used are as follows:\n\n     [1]     ship's speed full stop\n     [2]     ship's speed ahead half\n     [3]     ship's speed ahead full\n     [-]     drop depth charge\n     [/]     abort game\n     [+/-]   toggle sound\n     [<-]    exit program\n     [Enter] restart program\n\nScoring for the game is based on the depth of the sub, multiplied by one\nplus it's velocity.  For example:\nIf a sub is at a depth of 50, and he is stopped then he is worth 50 points.\nA sub at the same depth of 50, but moving at 1/2 speed is worth 100 points.\nA sub at a depth of 50, but moving at full speed is worth 150 points.\n\nThe time limit for the game is about 2.5 minutes.  At about 1:45 into the\ngame a warning buzzer goes off and an almost empty hourglass is displayed\nby your score to let you know that the game is about over.\n\nOnce the game is over your score, the high score, the number of charges\ndropped, the number of subs hit, and your hit percentage are displayed.\n\nA good game is about 2800 or so, and a really good game is around 3500.  I\nhaven't had a whole lot of time to play it, but my high is 3551.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks to Erik Bryntse for his S-CHIP interpreter, which was an extension\nto Andreas Gustafsson's CHIP-48 interpreter.
